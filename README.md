## Development using Docker

This repository ships with a Docker Compose configuration intended for development purposes. It'll build a PHP image with all needed extensions installed and start up a MySQL server and a Node image watching the UI assets.

To get started, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- Docker and Docker Compose are installed
- Your user is part of the `docker` group

If all the conditions are met, you can proceed with the following steps:

1. Make sure **port 8080 is unused** *or else* change `DEV_PORT` to a free port on your host.
2. **Run `chgrp -R docker storage`**. The development container will chown the `storage` directory to the `www-data` user inside the container so Taskord can write to it. You need to change the group to your host's `docker` group here to not lose access to the `storage` directory.
3. **Run `docker-compose up`** and wait until all database migrations have been done.
4. You can now login with `test` and `test` as password on `localhost:8080` (or another port if specified).

If needed, You'll be able to run any artisan commands via docker-compose like so:

 ```sh
docker-compose run app php artisan list 
```
